    "Python is a general purpose computer language that is very useful for many things, from data analysis and plotting to shell scripting and file management. There’s almost nothing it can’t be made to do! It’s also relatively easy to learn and is a great first language if you aren’t a CS major. If you do any work in the future in a technical field, the odds are that Python will be useful for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of this first Python lab are to demonstrate the different types of variables available to you, to explore some basic variable manipulation, to see how to import packages and one way to read in a file, and to make a first plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, you can write entire computer programs in Python as files that you call from the command line, but this Jupyter Notebook environment is useful for simple data manipulation projects and prototyping your larger programs.  To use a Jupyter Notebook, enter the code you want to run into a cell, then evalulate that cell by pressing Shift+Return.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HUGELY HELPFUL TIP:** Jupyter Notebooks also importantly allow you to use the \"Tab\" button to auto-complete the names of functions and variables to speed up typing and reduce mistakes.  You can also access a function's help documentation in the Jupyter environment by pressing Shift+Tab after typing the name of the function."
