    "Python is a programming language that we astronomers have adopted into our livelihoods. The challenge in learning Python (and all of programming really) is to translate your intentions (human language) into logic and syntax the computer understands. **It is totally analogous to learning a new language.** Fortunately, Python helps us out because it is designed to be readable. This means that each line of code you write is readable like a sentence or mathematical expression that both we and the computer can understand. Another reason astronomers like Python is because it is very robust for our needs. It's great at doing math (physics!), reading and writing our data files (which can be huuuuuge sometimes), and displaying our data and results in cute & pretty plots. So let's dig into how Python works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally in this course we would be able to help you in person in the computer lab during your assignments. However because of... y'know, we've built this notebook to give you a crashcourse on the basics of Python. This is by no means a comprehensive education on programming and you WILL need to continue learning as you go on but it should give you a solid enough basis to not get wiped out by our assignments at the start. \n",
    "\n",
    "But don't worry, as you get further in your career you'll slowly get better. Most students come in with zero coding background at all so we'll do our best to make sure you're well prepared. For students who have taken a CS class before, this will all be a review however I encourage you to still look through it as a refresher. For those students who have taken AP Computer Science, that goes doubly for you as Python is similar to Java but there are some key differences you need to be aware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python accomplishes tasks using a few fundamental building blocks of the language:\n",
    "* **Integers (*int*)** - Integers are just whole numbers, 1, 1637, -52, etc.\n",
    "* **Floats (*float*)** - Floats are more exact than integers. For example, 1.0 is a float whereas 1 is an ineger\n",
    "* **Strings (*str*)** - These are basically words and letters, and are distinguished and created by quotation marks, either double quotes or single quotes, i.e. ```\"this is a string\"``` or ```'this is also a string'```.\n",
    "    * The decision to use single vs. double quotes is mainly personal preference, but if you want to make a string that contains an apostrophe (a single quote marker) you must enclose the string in double quotes\n",
    "    * Note that numbers can be represented as strings too: \"1\" is a string, not an integer, but this is not useful for matematical calculations...\n",
    "\n",
    "Python then works by ordering these floats, ints, and strings with commands. So let's do it! :)"

    "Create a quadratic function and an array from 0 to 50 to use as X values. Plot X and f(X), with the y scale on logarithmic. Make the length:height ratio of the plot 2:1, the color something other than default blue, and the line not solid. Then create another X array, half the resolution as the other, and scatter plot X and f(X). Again, make the color anything other than default blue and the markers anything other than dots. Label the line plot 'Excellent Data' and have a legend. Title the plot 'My first Python plot'. Once you're happy with it, save it."

    "## Reading and Writing Data\n",
    "I keep talking about data and how big datasets can be, but where is it?? Surely we don't type in every single number and make a numpy array out of it? Fortunately for us, there are several ways Python can read in data. One of these is reading text files. Numpy has a nice function called $\\texttt{loadtxt}$ that reads in loads of numbers in text files and creates arrays we can work with. To show this, I'm going to make you do some of my research for me, mwahahahahahaha"

    "Here's two takeaways to remember:\n",
    "1) A good way to think about writing code is that it is like writing an instruction manual. There isn't necessarily always a \"best\" or \"right\" to write a manual for build a bird house, but there are \"wrong\" ways. You shouldn't trick someone into a building a fish aquarium, right? When writing an instruction manual you have a lot of helpful devices at your disposal, like diagrams and schematics. Think of operators, functions, and ***comments (yes, comment your code!)*** in your code as those same devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Lastly, **GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND**. There are plenty of resources out there. It is likely that someone else has had the same problem as you before. So try googling it. Like if you were struggling with plotting the light curve, you could google \"how to plot with matplotlih python\". Reliable websites are Stack Overflow, GitHub, and source code documentation (like Numpy and Matplotlib's website).\n",
