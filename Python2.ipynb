    "Last week you got familiar with how to manipulate some basic Python variable, one way to read in data, and how to make a simple plot.  This week you will extend your abilities in powerful ways, learning conditional statements, for and while loops, and how to write functions.  We will also touch on a more generic way to read and write files.\n",

    "Note that white space (placement of spaces/indentation) is important to how Python interprets your code.  You will see that indented lines are interpreted as a block of code that runs under the condition described before it in a line that ends with a colon (:).  It is important to keep track of our indentation to get your code to run as expected.\n",

You may want to refer to these examples (and those from the first Python Introduction) as you complete your Lab 2 assignments.  You are not required to copy and run all of these examples, since the output is shown here, but you may find it helpful to copy and modify some examples here to gain a better understanding of how they work."
